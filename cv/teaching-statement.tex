A significant factor in my preference for academia is the opportunity to engage
and interact with students.
%
The undeniable importance of education in society and the value of sharing the
knowledge we acquire are further factors in strengthening such a preference.

During the course of my doctoral studies, although I've been funded as a
graduate research assistant through a multitude of grants, I have served as an
unofficial teaching assistant for four offerings of the undergraduate AI course
(ECE 473) and four offerings of the graduate AI course (ECE 570), each such
course offering comprising approximately 20 students.
%
In such a capacity, I held office hours, marked assignments and exams,
interacted with the students via email, and even taught the odd lecture.
%
Furthermore, as part of the Purdue Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships
(SURF) program, I've mentored four undergraduate students, introducing them to,
and guiding them through, the process of conducting research.
%
I also had the opportunity to recruit yet more students in the course of my own
research, orchestrating data-gathering and analysis efforts that resulted in a
publication [{\color{RoyalBlue} C7}] with all the students as co-authors.

Prior to graduate school, I served as a part-time instructor for the GRE and
GMAT standardized exams for \href{http://www.princetonreview.com/}{The
  Princeton Review} while I was an undergraduate student in Chennai, India.
%
As part of my responsibilities over a 10 month period from October 2007 to
August 208, I tutored more than 200 students for both the math and verbal
components of these exams.
\vspace*{1ex}

Such experiences have given me an understanding of some of the qualities
required to be an effective teacher.
%
As far potential subjects go, I am happy to teach any course in the
undergraduate CS curriculum. This includes courses that are directly related to
my research, which involves a wide variety of topics such as algorithms,
robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, digital signal
processing, machine learning, compilers, optimization, functional programming,
programming languages, distributed systems, and broader AI.
