<!-- What I want this to look like: -->
<!--  - a 'boxed' element for each research enterprise that gives an overview of -->
<!--    that project -->
<!--  - Each also includes video > picture > rule_block as the 'snapshot' -->
<!--    - decide on whether video is going to be hosted locally or on youtube -->
<!--      currently leaning towards youtube -->
<!--  - Clicking on ''read_more'' should open a page with fuller description, along -->
<!--    with pointers to code/CAD-stuff/videos/images as necessary. -->
<!--    Also includes the appropriate publications (duplicate relevant from publications) -->

> People often perceive and/or infer things about the world by incorporating
> information available from multiple sources in the context of world
> knowledge. This ability to integrate information both within and across
> modalities is the primary focus of my research, especially, the integration
> between vision and language. Furthermore, such information is very often
> compositional, thanks to the generative nature of both vision and language.
> \
> I endeavour to build systems that explore and exploit such features, enabling
> cross-modal integration, and in the process, gain further insight into the
> coupled processes of perception and inference.
