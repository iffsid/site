<!-- What I want this to look like: -->
<!--  - a 'boxed' element for each research enterprise that gives an overview of -->
<!--    that project -->
<!--  - Each also includes video > picture > rule_block as the 'snapshot' -->
<!--    - decide on whether video is going to be hosted locally or on youtube -->
<!--      currently leaning towards youtube -->
<!--  - Clicking on ''read_more'' should open a page with fuller description, along -->
<!--    with pointers to code/CAD-stuff/videos/images as necessary. -->
<!--    Also includes the appropriate publications (dupilcate relevant from publications) -->

I work at the
[Center for the Computational Study of Cognition, Communication, Control, and Perception](http://upplysingaoflun.ecn.purdue.edu/~qobi/cccp/),
with [Jeffrey Mark Siskind](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~qobi/),
at Purdue University.


My research involves the confluence of computer vision, robotics,
natural-language processing, and elements of cognitive neuroscience, towards a
central research goal to ground semantics in different modalities.
