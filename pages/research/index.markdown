<!-- What I want this to look like: -->
<!--  - a 'boxed' element for each research enterprise that gives an overview of -->
<!--    that project -->
<!--  - Each also includes video > picture > rule_block as the 'snapshot' -->
<!--    - decide on whether video is going to be hosted locally or on youtube -->
<!--      currently leaning towards youtube -->
<!--  - Clicking on ''read_more'' should open a page with fuller description, along -->
<!--    with pointers to code/CAD-stuff/videos/images as necessary. -->
<!--    Also includes the appropriate publications (dupilcate relevant from publications) -->

People often perceive and/or infer things about the world by incorporating
information available from multiple sources in the context of world
knowledge. This ability to integrate information both within and across
modalities is the primary focus of my research, especially, the integration
between vision and language. I endeavour to build systems that exhibit this
ability, and in the process, gain further insight into the processes of
perception and inference.
