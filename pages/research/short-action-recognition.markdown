Here, we show how the compositional structure of events, in concert with the
compositional structure of language, can interplay with the underlying focusing
mechanisms in video action recognition. Such an integrated framework allows for
a multitude of tasks simply by leveraging its features in different ways. This
allows, on videos depicting multiple activities, to perform taks such as
sentential-query based video retrieval, sentential video description, and a
natural-language guided focus-of-attention mechanism.
