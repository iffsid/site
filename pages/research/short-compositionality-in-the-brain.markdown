In keeping with the overarching theme, we further explore compositionality in a
fist-of-its-kind study where people in an fMRI machine are shown videos
depicting activities that correspond to unique sentential descriptions. By
classifying brain-activity with different subsets of the sentential structure,
first independently and then jointly, we show that brain-activity patterns
reflect compositionality in sentence structure as the composition of
independent classifications matches those obtained jointly.
