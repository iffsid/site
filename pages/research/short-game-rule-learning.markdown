Children learn to play games by watching others play. While both formal board
games such as Chess and Checkers, and less formal play such as Hopscotch and
Tag, all have well defined rules that children ultimately come to know, they
are rarely told those rules explicitly.  This work features an integrated
vision and robotic system that plays, __and learns to play__, simple
physically-instantiated board games that are variants of TicTacToe and
Hexapawn.  The rules of the games are learned solely by observing physical play
can subsequently be used to drive further physical play.
