This work involves reasoning about the physical structure of composable
entities, involving integration within vision, and across vision and language,
through the medium of robotics. It shows how even information extracted from
unreliable sources, such as low-level image-feature detectors in the presence
of noise and occlusion, is useful when reasoned about in the context of basic
world knowledge such as rules regarding how such assemblies may be composed and
incorporation of additional information in the form of changing viewpoints,
physical interaction, and natural-language descriptions.
