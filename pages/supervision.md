Please send any enquiries via email (with your CV) using the tag **`[Phd-Enquiry]`** in the subject, along with either **`[<project title>]`** or **[`General`]** depending on whether you're applying to work on a specified project below or otherwise.

In reaching out to me, it would be quite helpful if you explain (briefly)

  * why you want to work with _my group_ specifically,
  * what you've worked on,
  * what you'd be interested in exploring going forward, and
  * how that would fit in with what we been working on.

Ideally, this would be in the form of a research proposal (1-2 pages) that could form the core of a potential PhD thesis.

## General

Outside of any potential opportunities listed below, there are a range of avenues for pursuing a PhD with me, including through the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/), or the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in [Natural Language Procesing (NLP)](https://nlp-cdt.ac.uk/), [Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org), and [Biomedical AI](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai).
<br/>
Please refer to the information on these pages to learn about the application process, timescales, and funding options.

Additionally, I supervise students through the [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).
<br/>
This will require submitting an application to both the ELLIS program and to the School of Informatics.

### MSc (Thesis)

For prospective Masters students, please see the School's [MSc by Research](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/applying/research/masters-by-research) page for details on applying.
