### Interpretable Representation Learning through Embodied Constraints

Funding: School of Informatics <br/>
Eligibility: UK/EU/International <br/>
Start: Sept 2021/Jan 2022

The focus here is fairly broad, with a nominal goal to leverage data from multiple _modalities_, such as vision, language, and proprioception, to learn representations in deep latent-variable models that faithfully capture the conceptual commonalities across modalities, for example, what a _kite_ is, or what it means to have _wings_, without explicit supervision, while retaining the abilities typically expressed within individual domains---interventions and generations.
The idea is to reason about the characteristic latent features derived from such models---to identify interpretable components, capture notions of 'relatedness', along with broad dependency structure reflecting the nature of collective data observed.
