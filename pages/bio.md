Siddharth N. (Sid) is a Reader in Explainable AI in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, a part-time Senior Research Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, and an ELLIS Scholar. He was previously a Senior Researcher in Engineering at the University of Oxford and a Postdoctoral Scholar in Psychology at Stanford. He obtained his PhD from Purdue University in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

His research interests are broadly cross-disciplinary and motivated by problems found at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, natural-language processing, cognitive science, robotics, and neuroscience. In particular, he is interested in unsupervised learning of structured representations from perceptual data, and establishing common ground between machines and humans through interaction, with implications for building robust, generalisable, and interpretable AI and ML systems.
